PROJECT TITLE - NCFL
The Professional Sports League of Chicken Fighting (in the pool).


The Idea:
    Our orginal thought was to make something unqiue to the prompt. While most others focus on a single serivce and/or product. We focused on something of a much larger scale. Being the huge sports fans we are, we knew the direction we wanted to go. All we were missing was a sport. From this, we chose a recreational game we all have played, and crafted it into a competative enterprise. Our inspiration came from interfaces such as the offical NFL website and sports broadcasting companies such as ESPN. However, we wanted to put our own twist on it. This could be seen through a more creative, exciting, and slightly humerous user interface than our sources on inspriation. Thus, the NCFL idea was set in stone.


The Process:
    Samuel Latham:
        I led the charge in our Figma planning stage, as we collaborated to craft a design a unique interface that still felt comfortable to our users. We begun our coding and I served as a bridge between the structure and the content. I would implement the content that we derived in acreeative way, amking use of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap fucntions to engage users. I through in the basic Navbar and footer idea, and Brandon made it completeley functional. Using the teams Drake had created, made a playoff bracket. I focused alot on filling in the gaps and helping both Drake and Brandon when they got overwhelmed. I filled in team pages, did color editing, and created colorful story for our homepage. I implemented the contact information and our company logo of Los Pollos Hermanos. The heading above the navbar on each page was also my work. along with filling in the store and pricing merchandise. But the work I am most proud of is the team map. Having to switch from a complex javascript map to a more rudimentary format was dissapointing, but learning about how to create an area map and make the lgos clickable on the image made it more than worth it.  
    
    Drake Wallace:
        Due to the large amount of content required to fill the website, I was in charge of finding and creating the content and media for the entire website. The content that I was in charge of creating were aspects suchs as teams, players, team information, as well as all of the photos found on the site. One of our more inclusive pieces were the home-made videos. I was included throughout the filming process and completed the editing myself. Thus, I assumbed the role of media manager for our website.

    Brandon Granillo:
        I assumed the role of Lead Developer. I assissted both Samuel and Drake whenever they needed help with certain tasks, as well as a fullfilling my own duties. My duities were creating all responsiveness, functionallity, and most all structure. As ideas were brought up I took charge in bringing them to life. I started with the navbar, which was my first real task. Afterwards, I impleted the carousels throught the website, thus allowing Drake to fill thme with media. Next, I had the idea implement the scores at the top our our homepage. This was were I truly began to understand the grid system in bootstrap........................ A Minor tasks I did during this process was keeping all code organized and adding comments to just about everything. Along with Drake I



Final Thoughts: 
    This project opened our eyes to a world of possibilities that coding offers. It showed us the creative process for interfaces that we use each and every single day. Embracing both innovative ideas and teamwork, we significantly enhanced our work efficiency, allowing us to create a collaborative and well-versed website.
